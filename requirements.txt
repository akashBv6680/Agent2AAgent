# LangChain's core library
langchain

# LangChain's integration libraries (these contain modularized components)
# 'langchain-openai' for the ChatOpenAI/OpenAI LLM
langchain-openai

# 'langchain-community' for various integrations, including tools like DuckDuckGoSearch
langchain-community

# Tool dependencies (e.g., if you use the DuckDuckGo search tool)
duckduckgo-search

# Optional: If you are using Streamlit's callback handler (highly recommended for streaming)
# If your previous code used StreamlitCallbackHandler, this ensures it's available.
# The callback is often included in langchain-community, but having it explicitly helps.
# For modern LangChain, the callbacks are typically handled by StreamlitCallbackHandler 
# which is part of the core LangChain ecosystem now.
# This list is comprehensive for a typical agent setup.
